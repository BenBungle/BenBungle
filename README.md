### Hi there my name is Benjamin Vilaplana Stark or Jammmin aka BenBungleðŸ‘‹

I'm currently searching for a full stack software developer job 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with more front-end projects to get better at what at I'm weak.

What I mostly like to work on its on back-end, but as a full stack developer, knowing both paths is a must.

I'm looking foward to get experience on Web/software Developing so I can move towards the path of Cibersecurity and Ethical Hacking, furthermore would be MachineLearning and LLM.

I'm open to learn progamming languages the company needs


Possibilities are measured by our own actions and mentality to progress and go foward and beyond within ourselves and outside.
